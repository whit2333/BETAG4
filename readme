Need to have ROOT. Specifically you need libraries in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and rootcint in your PATH.
> ./buildRootDict
> make
> cd run
This is where all the input data files are, so you need to run the program in this directory.

> ckov (mac file if wanted)

ckov> run/beamOn 100
ckov> exit

This produces a ckov.root file for analysis.
