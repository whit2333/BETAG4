#   PBS scripts execute in your home directory, not the
#   directory from which they were submitted. The following
#   line places you in the directory from which the job
#   was submitted.
#
# cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
cd $HOME/sane08/BETAG4/run

#
#   Now we want to run the program "hello".  "hello" is in
#   the directory that this script is being submitted from,
